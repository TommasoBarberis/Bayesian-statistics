# Example of Bayesian inference on a model in ecotoxicology

Our aim is to study the effect of a toxic substance suspected to pollute lakes and rivers. We wish to model the effect of this substance on the death rate of daphnids (small invertebrates of fresh water, called "water feas").
An in vitro experiment has been conducted to observe the effect of the pollutant concentration on the death rate of 20 organisms after an exposition of 21 days.
The data for this experiment:
